# Lagrange fluid simulation
Fragment shaders used to smooth out particles used as a mean for Lagrange fluid approximation. 
* depth FS: Rendering particles as spheres.
* smooth FS: Smoothing depth buffer using bilateral filter.
* normals FS: Computing normal vectors for the fluid's surface.
* lighting FS: Blinn-Phong specular lighting model for the fluid's surface.
